# Where to Park or Invest Money Other Than Equities and Equity Mutual Funds?

---

## 1. Bank FD (Fixed Deposits)

**Explanation:**  
Bank fixed deposits are the most traditional and safest investment option in India. Returns are guaranteed if held till maturity, and funds can be withdrawn prematurely with a small penalty. FDs are offered by all major banks and are ideal for conservative investors who prioritize capital safety over high returns. They are suitable for building an emergency fund, saving for short-term goals, or simply parking surplus cash. While the returns may not always beat inflation, the peace of mind and simplicity make FDs a staple in most Indian households. Note that interest is taxable, and premature withdrawal may incur a penalty. Always prefer nationalized or top private banks for maximum safety.

**Expected Returns:** 6% – 7.5%  
**Risk Level:** None  
**Taxation:** Income slab rate  
**Ideal Holding Period:** 7 days – 10 years  
**Withdrawal Speed:** Instant within hours  
**Exit Load:** Prematurely break (~0.5–1%)  
**Volatility:** None  
**Investment Mode:** Lumpsum only  
**Return Consistency:** Guaranteed if held  
**Invests In:** Bank deposits  
**Suitable For:** Safest option for risk-free savings  
**Good Things:** Guaranteed returns, safest and simple

## 2. Top-Rated NBFC FD

**Explanation:**  
Top-rated NBFC FDs are fixed deposits offered by non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) with high credit ratings. They offer higher interest rates than traditional bank FDs, making them attractive for investors seeking better returns. However, they carry a small credit risk, as NBFCs are not covered by the same deposit insurance as banks. It is crucial to choose only highly rated companies (AAA or equivalent) to minimize risk. These FDs are suitable for investors who want to diversify their fixed income portfolio and are willing to accept a slightly higher risk for better returns. Always check the credit rating and financial health of the NBFC before investing, and avoid locking in large sums for long periods.

**Expected Returns:** 7% – 8.5%  
**Risk Level:** Very Low  
**Taxation:** Income slab rate  
**Ideal Holding Period:** 1–5 years  
**Withdrawal Speed:** Instant within hours  
**Exit Load:** Prematurely break (~0.5–1.5%)  
**Volatility:** Very Low  
**Investment Mode:** Lumpsum only  
**Return Consistency:** Very High (Stable)  
**Invests In:** Company deposits

While the interest rates are attractive, the credit risk is higher than with large banks, and the reputation of the bank should be carefully considered. Only invest amounts within the insured limit for maximum safety, and always check the bank's financial health and regulatory compliance before investing.

**Expected Returns:** 7.5% – 9%  
**Risk Level:** Moderate

## 4. Overnight Fund

**Explanation:**  
Overnight funds invest only in debt securities that mature in one day. This means the fund manager buys securities that are repaid the very next day, making these funds virtually free from interest rate risk and credit risk. They are considered the safest among mutual funds, ideal for parking money for a few days when you want instant access and don’t want to take any risk. However, the returns are very low, often just above a savings account, and not suitable for long-term growth. These funds are widely used by corporates and high-net-worth individuals for treasury management, but retail investors can also use them for short-term parking of large sums. There is no exit load, and the NAV is extremely stable, making them a step above a savings account for idle cash.

**How to use:** Overnight funds are best for individuals or businesses who need to park large sums temporarily (for example, after a property sale or before a big payment). They are also used by corporates for treasury management. For retail investors, they are a step above a savings account for idle cash, but not a replacement for emergency funds or long-term investments.

**Expected Returns:** 4% – 5%  
**Risk Level:** Very Low  
**Taxation:** Income slab rate  
**Ideal Holding Period:** 1–7 days  
**Withdrawal Speed:** Same day (T+0)  
**Exit Load:** None  
**Volatility:** Very Low  
**Investment Mode:** Lumpsum only  
**Return Consistency:** Very High (Stable)  
**Invests In:** 1-day maturity debt  
**Suitable For:** Ultra-short parking, emergency funds  
**Good Things:** Safest, zero volatility  
**Things to Note:** Very low returns  
**Examples:** HDFC Overnight, ICICI Overnight

## 5. Liquid Fund

**Explanation:**  
Liquid funds invest in high-quality money market instruments like treasury bills, commercial paper, and certificates of deposit with maturities up to 91 days. They are designed for investors who want to park their money for a few days to a few weeks and need quick access to their funds. Withdrawals are usually processed within 24 hours. Liquid funds are very low risk, but returns can fluctuate slightly. They are a popular choice for emergency funds and short-term surplus cash. These funds are regulated to ensure high liquidity and safety, and many platforms offer instant redemption features, making them almost as liquid as a savings account but with better returns. However, they are not meant for long-term wealth creation, and returns may not always beat inflation.

**How to use:** Liquid funds are ideal for building an emergency fund or for parking money you may need at short notice (such as for a planned purchase or travel). Many platforms offer instant redemption features, making them almost as liquid as a savings account but with better returns. They are not meant for long-term wealth creation, but are a great alternative to letting money sit idle in a bank.

**Expected Returns:** 6% – 6.5%  
**Risk Level:** Very Low  
**Taxation:** Income slab rate  
**Ideal Holding Period:** 1–30 days

## 6. Money Market Fund

**Explanation:**

They aim to provide better returns than liquid funds while still keeping risk very low. These funds are suitable for investors who want to park money for a few weeks to a few months and are comfortable with a little less liquidity than liquid funds. They are a good option for short-term goals or as a step up from a savings account. The underlying instruments are high-quality, and the risk of default is extremely low. However, returns are not guaranteed and can fluctuate slightly with market conditions. These funds are best for conservative investors who want a safe place to park money for a short period, such as for planned expenses or as a buffer in their portfolio.

**How to use:** Money market funds are best for short-term goals like paying insurance premiums, school fees, or any planned expense within a year. They are also suitable for conservative investors who want to avoid the volatility of equity or longer-term debt funds. Returns are not guaranteed, but the risk of loss is extremely low if held for the recommended period.

**Expected Returns:** 6.3% – 6.8%

These funds may see mild fluctuations in value, but are generally stable and suitable for short-term goals or as a step up from a savings account. The underlying assets are carefully selected to balance safety and yield, making these funds a good choice for conservative investors who want to earn more than a savings account without taking significant risk. However, they are not suitable for long-term wealth creation, and returns may be affected by sudden changes in interest rates.

**How to use:** Use ultra short-term funds for any savings goal 3 to 6 months away, like a wedding, vacation, or major purchase. They offer better returns than a savings account or fixed deposit, with low risk. Ideal for conservative investors or those with short-term financial goals.

## 8. Arbitrage Fund

**Explanation:**  
Arbitrage funds use a strategy that takes advantage of price differences between the cash and derivatives markets for the same stock. They buy in one market and sell in another, locking in a small profit. This makes them very low risk compared to other equity funds, but returns are also limited. They are tax-efficient for short-term investments because they are treated as equity for tax purposes. Suitable for conservative investors who want equity taxation but don’t want to take equity market risk. These funds are not affected much by market volatility, but returns can be lower than other equity funds in a stable market. They are best used for short-term parking of funds, especially for investors in higher tax brackets.

**How to use:** Invest in arbitrage funds if you are in the highest tax bracket and want to park money for the short term. They provide equity-like returns with much lower risk and are not affected by market volatility. Ideal for conservative investors or as a short-term parking place for funds.

The underlying assets are selected to minimize credit risk, and the fund manager actively manages the portfolio to optimize returns. These funds are best for conservative investors who want to earn more than a savings account without taking significant risk, but are not suitable for long-term wealth creation.
