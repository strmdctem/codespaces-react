# What is an Arbitrage Fund?

An **Arbitrage Fund** is a type of **hybrid mutual fund** that aims to earn **low-risk returns** by exploiting **price differences** in the stock market.

## How It Works

- A stock is trading at ₹100 in the **cash market** (today’s market)
- But it's trading at ₹102 in the **futures market** (future delivery price)

The fund manager:

- **Buys** the stock at ₹100 in the cash market
- **Sells** it at ₹102 in the futures market

The ₹2 difference is the **profit (arbitrage)**—with virtually no risk because the buy & sell are locked.

## Why Choose an Arbitrage Fund Over FDs?

| Criteria               | Arbitrage Fund                     | Fixed Deposit (FD)                     |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Returns**            | 6–8% (market-linked)               | 6–7.5% (fixed)                         |
| **Risk**               | Very low (market neutral)          | Very low                               |
| **Tax (after 1 year)** | 10% on gains above ₹1.25 lakh      | Taxed as per your slab (e.g., 30%)     |
| **Liquidity**          | Can be withdrawn in 1–2 days       | Usually 1–5 years lock-in              |
| **Best For**           | Short-term or parking surplus cash | Fixed savings with predictable returns |

## When Should You Avoid Arbitrage Funds?

- If you need **instant liquidity** (withdrawal takes T+1 or T+2 days)
- If you're looking for **high returns** (this is more for stability)
- If the market is **too stable** (low volatility = fewer arbitrage opportunities = lower returns)

## Who Should Invest?

| Scenario                            | Tax Implication                                                                    | Why Arbitrage Fund Makes Sense                                                                          |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **You want to invest for < 1 year** | Short-term capital gains (STCG) taxed at **15% flat**                              | Great for people in **20–30% tax slabs**—you pay lower tax than FDs (which are taxed at your slab rate) |
| **You want to invest for > 1 year** | Long-term capital gains (LTCG) taxed at **10%** on gains above **₹1.25 lakh/year** | Much better than FDs where entire interest is taxed at your slab rate—**you save significantly on tax** |

## Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) — Updated

If your total gain in LTCG is **below ₹1.25 lakh/year**, there is **no tax**.

**Examples:**

- ₹90,000 LTCG → No tax
- ₹1.5 lakh LTCG → Tax only on ₹25,000 = ₹2,500 (at 10%)

## Real-Life Examples (Assuming 30% Tax Slab)

### Scenario A: Invest ₹5 lakhs for 8 months

- Fund returns: 7% annualized → approx. ₹23,000 gain
- Tax (STCG): **15% of ₹23,000 = ₹3,450**
- If this was FD:
  - ₹23,000 gain taxed at **30% = ₹6,900**
  - Arbitrage Fund saves ₹3,450 in tax

### Scenario B: Invest ₹5 lakhs for 15 months

- Fund returns: 7% → approx. ₹44,000 gain
- LTCG applies → First ₹1.25 lakhs/year is **tax-free**
- Tax = ₹0 (if no other equity LTCG that year)
- Much more tax-efficient than FD (would pay ₹13,200 tax on same FD interest)

## You Should Consider Arbitrage Funds If

- You're in a **higher income tax bracket (20–30%)**
- You want a **safe place to park money** for **3–18 months**
- You're saving for **short-term goals** (e.g., home down payment, emergency fund, business contingency)
- You want **low volatility + better post-tax returns** than FDs
