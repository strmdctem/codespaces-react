What is an Arbitrage Fund?

An Arbitrage Fund is a type of hybrid mutual fund that aims to earn low-risk returns by exploiting price differences in the stock market.

How it works:

Let’s say:

- A stock is trading at ₹100 in the cash market (today’s market),
- But it’s trading at ₹102 in the futures market (future delivery price).

The fund:

- Buys the stock at ₹100 in the cash market,
- Sells it at ₹102 in the futures market.

The ₹2 difference is the profit (arbitrage)—with virtually no risk because the buy & sell are locked.

Why Choose an Arbitrage Fund Over FDs?

| Criteria           | Arbitrage Fund                     | Fixed Deposit (FD)                     |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Returns            | 6–8% (market-linked)               | 6–7.5% (fixed)                         |
| Risk               | Very low (market neutral)          | Very low                               |
| Tax (after 1 year) | 10% on gains above ₹1 lakh         | Taxed as per your slab (e.g., 30%)     |
| Liquidity          | Can be withdrawn in 1–2 days       | Usually 1–5 years lock-in              |
| Best for           | Short-term or parking surplus cash | Fixed savings with predictable returns |

When Should You Avoid Arbitrage Funds?

- If you need instant liquidity (withdrawal takes T+1 or T+2 days).
- If you're looking for high returns (this is more for stability).
- If the market is too stable (low volatility = fewer arbitrage opportunities = lower returns).

Who Should Invest?

| Scenario                                   | Tax Implication                                                                | Why Arbitrage Fund Makes Sense                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. You want to invest for less than 1 year | Short-term capital gains (STCG) taxed at 15% (flat rate)                       | Great for people in 20% or 30% tax slabs—you pay lower tax than FDs (which are taxed at your slab rate).    |
| 2. You want to invest for more than 1 year | Long-term capital gains (LTCG) taxed at 10% on gains above ₹1.25 lakh per year | Much better than FDs where entire interest is taxed at your slab rate ( 30%)—you save significantly on tax. |

Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG)

If your total gain in LTCG is below 1 lakh there is not tax

So, if your total LTCG from all equity-related investments (including stocks + equity mutual funds + arbitrage funds) is:

- ₹90,000 → No tax
- ₹1.5 lakh → Tax only on ₹50,000 = ₹5,000

Examples with 30% tax slab:

Scenario A: Invest ₹5 lakhs for 8 months

- Fund returns: 7% annualized → approx. ₹23,000 gain
- Tax (STCG): 15% on ₹23,000 = ₹3,450
- If this was FD with same 7% percent returns: ₹23,000 gain taxed at 30% = ₹6,900  
   Arbitrage Fund saves ₹3,450 in tax

Scenario B: Invest ₹5 lakhs for 15 months

- Fund returns: 7% → approx. ₹44,000 gain
- LTCG applies, but first ₹1.25 lakhs/year is tax-free
- Tax: ₹0 if no other equity gains as LTCG is below 1.25 lakhs.  
    Much more tax-efficient than FD (₹13,200 tax on same FD interest)

You should consider Arbitrage Funds if:

- You're in a higher income tax bracket (20–30%)
- You want a safe place to park money for 3–18 months
- You're saving for short-term goals (e.g., home down payment, emergency fund, business contingency)
- You want liquidity with low volatility and better post-tax returns than FDs
